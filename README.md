# 19_submission

Some of the projects I worked on while studying at 19 (Part of 42's network):

**1. Libft**: This project aims to code a C library regrouping usual functions that we will be allowed to use in all our other projects.

**2. Get_next_line**: The aim of this project is to make us code a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor.

**3. Born2beroot**: This project aims to introduce us to the wonderful world of virtualization.

**4. Printf**: Goal of the project is to recode the (in)famous printf.

**5. Solong**: This project is a very small 2D game. It is built to make us work with textures, sprites and some very basic gameplay elements.

**6. Pipex**: This projectâ€™s objectives is to discover pipes, a very important UNIX mechanism.

**7. Push_swap**: Goal is to sort a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed we have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

**8. Minishell**: The objective of this project is to re-create from scratch a simple shell like bash.

**9. Philosophers**: This project teaches the basics of threading a process and using mutexes through the famous Dining Philosopher Problem.

**10. Net_Practice**: Goal of the project is to solve networking problems to make a network run.
