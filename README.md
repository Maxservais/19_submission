# 19_submission

Some of the projects I worked on while studying at 19 (Part of 42's network):

1. Libft
This project aims to code a C library regrouping usual functions that we will be allowed to use in all our other projects.

2. Get_next_line
The aim of this project is to make us code a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor.

3. Born2beroot
This project aims to introduce us to the wonderful world of virtualization.

4. Printf
Goal of the project is to recode the (in)famous printf.

5. Solong
This project is a very small 2D game. It is built to make us work with textures, sprites and some very basic gameplay elements.
